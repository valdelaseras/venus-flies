                        Each player starts with 20 points and 20 health. If you reach 0 health, you are disqualified from 
                        the match.

                        The game ends when one team reaches a collective 40 points, or all players on one team have been 
                        disqualified.

                        Use the <span class="highlight bold">spacebar</span> to chomp down on any flies that try to

                        Be smart about using this ability as you have a cooldown! Your fly trap will close rapidly, but 
                        will take a few seconds to reopen, during which time you cannot shut your trap again.
